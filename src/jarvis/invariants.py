"""Post-conditions — the OS checking that its own state still means what it says.

Every action the OS takes has an intended effect. An event log does not prove the effect
survived: `attention {"reason": "assumptions pending review"}` records that we set a
reason, not that the reason is still true ninety seconds later when an unrelated hook
overwrites it. That exact sequence shipped two work orders to the dashboard labelled
"waiting for your input" when what they actually needed was an assumption review — every
component behaved correctly and the resulting state was a lie.

So invariants here are **steady-state predicates**, not write-time assertions. They are
re-evaluated on every reconcile tick against the database as it currently is, which is
the only way to catch state that was correct when written and went wrong afterwards.

Three rules for this module:

1. **No LLM, ever.** These are cheap SQL-level predicates. Determinism is the point:
   the checker must be more trustworthy than the thing it checks.
2. **Repair only what is unambiguous.** A violation with exactly one correct resolution
   derivable from state (a stale reason, a phantom flag) is repaired automatically and
   the repair is recorded. Anything else is reported and left alone.
3. **Report once, not every tick.** Callers dedupe on `Violation.key`; a standing
   violation must not spam the timeline or the inbox.

Adding an invariant: write a `_check_*` generator yielding `Violation`s and register it
in `INVARIANTS`. Give it a stable id — ids appear in work order timelines and in
`jarvis doctor` output, so renaming one rewrites history.
